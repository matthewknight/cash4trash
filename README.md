# cash4trash (Simple Auction style site client using Vue.js)

> The People's Choice in Online Trash Swindling

> This site was designed in mind for extra creativity marks and I would describe its visual appeal as 'polarising'

# Also requires an auction server with a certain API specification

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
